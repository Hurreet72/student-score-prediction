# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction
This project uses a real-world dataset to predict students' **math scores** based on their **reading** and **writing** scores using Linear Regression.

# 📊 Features Used
- Reading Score
- Writing Score

# 🔍 What’s Inside
- Data cleaning & exploration
- Correlation analysis
- Linear regression model
- Error metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²)
- Try-your-own prediction logic

# 📁 Dataset
[Students Performance in Exams – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

# 🚀 How to Run
Use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter Notebook.

# ✅ Results
- **R² Score**: 0.68
- **MAE**: ~7.35
- **RMSE**: ~8.78

# 🧠 Future Improvements
- Add more features (e.g. gender, lunch, parental education)
- Try Random Forest or Decision Tree models
- Create a Streamlit app for live predictions
